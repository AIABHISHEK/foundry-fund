foundary provide a way to create address
so that we can send transaction from that address 

address add = makeAddr('testAddress')

the before transaction 
vm.prank(add)

but the problem with the this address is that this does not have any balance
so we use another cheat code  ''   deal   ''
vm.deal(add, 1 ether);

we can use hoax cheatcode to do prank and deal  

we can chisel to run solidity in cli
